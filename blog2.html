        <h1>What Is Cybersecurity?</h1>
        <p>
            Cy·ber·se·cur·i·ty. The practice of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic
            data, or the measures taken to achieve this.

            At least, that’s what the dictionary says. Do you agree?

            Over the years the term cybersecurity has been thrown around to the point where it is almost synonymous with
            terms like IT security or information security. It’s kind of like saying every square is a rectangle, but
            not every rectangle is a square.
        </p>
        <h1>Why Is Cybersecurity Important?</h1>
        <p>
            One of the many advantages to living in a world where every device is connected is convenience. It’s
            incredibly easy to conduct work, manage your social calendar, shop and make appointments from your
            smartphone or device. That’s why it’s become second nature to many of us.

            But, of course, the convenience of connected data also means threats from bad actors can do a lot of damage.
            Cybersecurity initiatives are essential to protecting our data and thus, our way of life.
