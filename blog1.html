        <h1>What Is VR/AR??</h1>
        <p>
            In the world of emerging technology, some new trends are almost invisible, enabling new applications while
            working behind the scenes. Virtual reality and augmented reality are not those types of trends. VR and AR
            are literally right in front of the end user’s eyes, and while there are some obvious consumer applications,
            businesses may not always see how they can tap into the potential.
        </p>
        <h1>What is Virtual Reality?</h1>
        <p>
            Virtual reality is the more common of the two trends, but it may have more limited possibilities within a
            business. Most people are familiar with VR from the video game industry, where it has been evolving for many
            years. The main ingredient of a VR system is some type of headset that completely takes over the user’s
            field of vision, providing an immersive experience. More advanced VR systems provide audio immersion,
            extremely high resolution, and positional tracking that allows users to move around and use their hands to
            interact with the virtual environment.

            The system requirements for VR range from a smartphone inserted into a simple cardboard eyepiece to a
            self-contained headset to wearables that connect to powerful computers that do the bulk of the processing.
            Regardless of the equipment involved, there is significant friction for the end user in setting up and using
            the technology.

            Given this friction, businesses have to think carefully about where they may want to implement VR.
            Conferencing is a possible solution, but the benefits to a VR conference have to be weighed against the cost
            of the equipment and the usability. Training holds more possibilities, but again there would have to be a
            sizable investment in the VR training program. For some companies, the return will be worth the investment,
            but it may be difficult for VR to reach mass adoption.

            What is Augmented Reality?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Augmented reality is far less immersive than virtual reality. In AR, some kind of device goes between a user
            and the physical environment, and information can be displayed while the user still has a normal view of
            their surroundings. Today, this is usually done with a smartphone or a wearable such as the early Google
            Glass experiment or Microsoft’s Hololens. Moving forward, the technology could be incorporated into everyday
            eyeglasses, building windows, or devices customized for specific situations.

            On the front end, the equipment needed for AR is less complex. On the back end, though, things get more
            complicated. While VR requires heavy processing to render high-resolution virtual environments, AR requires
            image recognition to analyze the physical environment, network management to transmit data depending on the
            real-time needs, and a database of information that can be displayed.

            However, the simplification of the front end and the wider range of possibilities from using the surrounding
            environment lead to broader potential for businesses. Providing additional information to an end user can
            add value in many different scenarios. Local information for tourists, equipment specifications for repair
            technicians, and virtual furnishing for interior designers are just a few of the ways AR is being used
            today.
