        <h1>HOW IMPORTANT IS WORK-LIFE BALANCE?</h1>
        <p>
            Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is not only important for health and relationships, but it can also
            improve your employee’s productivity, and ultimately performance. Put simply, if your people don’t view work
            as a chore, then they will work harder, make fewer mistakes and are more likely to become advocates for your
            brand.
            Businesses that gain a reputation for encouraging work-life balance have become very attractive – especially
            when you consider how difficult it can be to attract and retain younger workers these days. The Oxford
            Economic suggests, “Replacing an employee costs on average around £30,000 and it takes up to 28 weeks to get
            them up to speed.” Bearing this in mind, it might be a good idea to keep your existing employees happy.
            Focussing on work-life balance will help you draw a valuable talent-pool for new recruits and boost
            retention rates. It will save time and money, whilst ensuring a high level of in-house talent.


            Vacations are not a luxury, they are a necessity. A break from work will provide you with the chance to
            switch off and enjoy yourself, it is also a great opportunity to recuperate and recharge. This is essential
            to help your people improve productivity and focus when they return to the office.
            Numerous studies show that vacations increase company productivity and reduce stress. The American
            Sociological Association compiled a report, which suggests that a larger number of vacations lead to a
            decline in the psychological distress of people.
            An effective way to encourage your people to take time off is to implement a “use it or lose it” system –
            whereby any unused days will not be carried over at the end of the year or repaid financially.
